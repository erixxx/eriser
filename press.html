                Edge Risers: snowboarding accessory that can greatly improve the way you ride
                </p>
                <p>
                Loveland, CO (February 8, 2013) &#45; An IndieGoGo campaign, which has just recently started, is promoting a new snowboarding accessory called the Edge Risers, which improves the way you ride a snowboard. The campaign is run by father and son, professionals in their industries. They have a month to come up with the funding for what they say to be &quot;an exciting announcement for snowboarders everywhere&quot;.
                </p>
                <p>
                The Edge Risers are a special binding riser that lifts your boot and binding up further off the board, thus giving you a number of different advantages. According to their sleek new website, edge-risers.com, the Edge Risers help improve your riding ability in a number of ways, such as drastically helping those who may have larger feet from getting toe and heel drag; improving your carving responsiveness; and giving your board a better flex during turns. When the IndieGoGo campaign is over, Edge Risers will be sent out to those whom contributed enough to purchase their own pair of edge risers.
